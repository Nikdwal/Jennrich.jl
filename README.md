# Jennrich

Compute the canonical polyadic decomposition or (L,L,1) block term decomposition of a third order tensor using a pencil-based alorithm, also known as Jennrich's algorithm.

## Usage
Use `jennrich(A, r)` for the rank `r` CPD or `jennrich(A, L)` for the `(L[1],L[1],1), ..., (L[R], L[R], 1)`-BTD of `A`.
The result is returned in factor matrix format.
```
ùíØ = reshape(sum([kron(randn(9), randn(8), randn(7)) for i = 1:r]), (7,8,9))
A, B, C = jennrich(ùíØ, r)
```
